# Testing Lighthouse Audit - Instructions

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ All performance optimizations implemented
- ‚è≥ Production build in progress (started at 12:10 PM, still running...)
- ‚ùå Lighthouse audit not yet run

## Option 1: Test Locally (Wait for build to finish)

### Step 1: Monitor Build Progress
```bash
cd lana-portfolio

# Check if build is still running
ps aux | grep "next build"

# Watch build progress (wait until it shows "Ready" or "Build complete")
tail -f .next/trace
```

### Step 2: Start Production Server (after build completes)
```bash
npm run start
# Server will start on http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Run Lighthouse Audit
1. Open Chrome browser in **Incognito mode** (Cmd+Shift+N on Mac)
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Open Chrome DevTools (Cmd+Option+I or F12)
4. Click on **Lighthouse** tab
5. Select:
   - ‚úÖ Performance
   - ‚¨ú Accessibility (optional)
   - ‚¨ú Best Practices (optional)
   - ‚¨ú SEO (optional)
6. Device: **Desktop** (or Mobile to test mobile performance)
7. Click **"Analyze page load"**
8. Wait for audit to complete (~30 seconds)

### Expected Results:
- **Performance Score:** 98-100 ‚ú®
- **FCP:** ~500-600ms
- **LCP:** ~700-800ms
- **TBT:** ~40-70ms
- **CLS:** ~0.0

## Option 2: Deploy & Test on Vercel (Faster!)

### Step 1: Commit and Push Changes
```bash
cd /Users/em/web/Lana-Developer

# Check what files changed
git status

# Add all changes
git add lana-portfolio/

# Commit with message
git commit -m "perf: comprehensive performance optimizations for 100 score

- Optimized webpack configuration with advanced code splitting
- Replaced Framer Motion with CSS animations in critical components
- Implemented lazy loading for @tabler/icons-react
- Added font-display swap and preload for Geist fonts
- Added resource hints (preconnect/dns-prefetch)
- Optimized images with Next.js Image component
- Added GPU-accelerated CSS animations

Expected improvements:
- 50% reduction in JavaScript execution time
- 40% smaller bundle sizes through better code splitting
- Eliminated render-blocking resources
- Main thread work reduced from 3154ms to ~2000ms

Target: 98-100 Lighthouse Performance Score

# Push to trigger Vercel deployment
git push origin add-techstack
```

### Step 2: Wait for Vercel Deployment
- Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Wait for deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)
- Get the deployment URL (e.g., https://lana-developer.vercel.app)

### Step 3: Run Lighthouse on Live Site
1. Open Chrome in **Incognito mode**
2. Navigate to your Vercel deployment URL
3. Open DevTools > Lighthouse
4. Run audit with **"Clear storage"** enabled
5. Compare before (93) vs after (target: 98-100)

## Troubleshooting Build Issues

### If build takes too long (>10 minutes):
```bash
# Kill the build process
pkill -f "next build"

# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf lana-portfolio/.next
cd lana-portfolio
npm run build
```

### If build fails with errors:
Check the error message and verify:
1. All syntax is correct in modified files
2. No missing imports
3. TypeScript types are correct

### Common Issues:
- **"Module not found"**: Check import paths
- **"Invalid configuration"**: Check next.config.ts syntax
- **"Out of memory"**: Increase Node.js memory:
  ```bash
  NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run build
  ```

## What to Look For in Lighthouse Report

### Good Signs (Target: 100 score):
‚úÖ All metrics in green
‚úÖ FCP < 1.8s
‚úÖ LCP < 2.5s  
‚úÖ TBT < 300ms
‚úÖ CLS < 0.1
‚úÖ Speed Index < 3.4s

### Improvements from Optimizations:
- **Reduced JavaScript execution** (was: 1253ms)
- **Smaller bundle sizes** (webpack code splitting)
- **Faster font loading** (font-display: swap)
- **No layout shifts** (proper image sizing)
- **Smoother animations** (CSS instead of JS)

### Key Metrics to Compare:
| Metric | Before | Target After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Performance Score | 93 | 98-100 | +7 points |
| JavaScript Time | 1253ms | ~600ms | -50% |
| Main Thread Work | 3154ms | ~2000ms | -40% |
| Speed Index | 1709ms | ~1200ms | -500ms |

## After Testing

### If Score is 98-100: ‚úÖ SUCCESS!
Take a screenshot and celebrate! The optimizations worked.

### If Score is 95-97:
Good but can be better. Check:
- Are there any large images not optimized?
- Are third-party scripts blocking?
- Is the network throttling affecting results?

### If Score is still < 95:
- Check the "Opportunities" section in Lighthouse
- Look for any new warnings or errors
- Review the "Diagnostics" for specific issues
- Run the audit multiple times (scores can vary ¬±3 points)

## Quick Reference: Build Commands

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Kill all Node processes (if stuck)
pkill node
```

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify all files saved correctly
3. Try clearing cache: `rm -rf .next`
4. Restart from clean build

Good luck! üöÄ
